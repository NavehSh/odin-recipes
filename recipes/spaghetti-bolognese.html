    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Mom's spaghetti Bolognese recipe was passed on from my Italian grandfather.<br>
        The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic,<br>
        you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef.<br>
        You can also substitute 1/2 cup of red wine for the balsamic vinegar.
